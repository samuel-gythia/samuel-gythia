## Hi there ðŸ‘‹  
I'm **Samuel Gythia** (alias) (he/him), a theoretical physics master's student with a passion for quantum computing and emotionally rich storytelling.

ðŸ”­ Currently building **Koneko**, a next-gen Discord bot with advanced moderation, gamified currency systems, and a sleek full-stack dashboard.

ðŸŒ± Learning **German (A1â€“A2)** and diving deep into quantum computing as I prepare for a PhD in Germany.

ðŸ‘¯ Open to collaborating on open-source physics tools and narrative design in fantasy and sci-fi worlds.

ðŸ¤” Looking for support with React dashboard design, PhD application strategy (EU/Germany), and connecting with like-minded researchers.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about emotionally-driven fantasy writing, Discord bot design, or physics research planningâ€”I'm tackling CS and academic research side by side.
